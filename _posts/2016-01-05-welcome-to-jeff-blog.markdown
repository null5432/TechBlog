Hi, I'm Jeffrey.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

This file serves as your book's preface, a great place to describe your book's content and ideas.

$$	x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$

$$\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$$

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

\\[ \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{Z} \mathbf{P^\mathsf{T}} \\]
